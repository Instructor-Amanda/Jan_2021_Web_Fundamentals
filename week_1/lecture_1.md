## Overview of Student Resources ##
    * Learn Platform
        - lectures and discussion sections
        - readings and assignments
            * Goal - read through the readings before the EOD assignment before lecture
            * submit single files or zipped folder for multi-file assignments
    * Mattermost
        - Header has LOTS of helpful information
        - public channels for asking TAs questions!
        - Code Review link

## Overview of the Web ##
    * Request-Response Cycle
        - client "asks for things" (making a request to the server -> entering a url, clicking a link, submit form)
        - server "gets the request and does something in response" (shows client a new page, processes a form)
            * a computer with files, access to a database, and running an application that you're talking to!
        - database talks to the server as needed, depending on the request
    * Backend vs Frontend vs Full Stack Development
        - Web Fundamentals covers the "Big 3" - HTML, CSS, Javascript
            * HTML -> the core content
            * CSS -> the asthetics and design/layout
            * JS -> Interactivity (color changes, hovering actions, etc)

## Overview of Tools ##
    * Developer's tools or Inspect Tool (Chrome browser preferred)
    * VS Code
        - "open in browser" extension
        - maintain good naming convention!!!

## Intro to HTML ##
    * creating a new file with your terminal!
    * Syntax (tags and attributes)
        - html, head, and body tags
        - div tags
        - header tags (<h1> through <h6>)
        - paragraph (<p>) tags vs span tags
        - hyperlinks (<a href="link"></a>) and embedding images (<img src="source">)
            * what's inside? Attributes that define specific information for that tag, in the form of name="value"
            * "class" and "id" are very important attibributes for CSS/JS
    * Parent/Child/Sibling (PCS) Relationships
        * How you space information is not required for functionality but highly recommended! (it WILL be graded on the exam)
